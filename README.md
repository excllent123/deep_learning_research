### Basic Information
- Authors : Kent Chiu (Jin-Chun)
- Tuning a deep learning model is sometimes time consuming especially you are working on a project that with a keeping changing dataset... 
- This project is under construction and trying to figure out a way to fast retrival the relative model structure, meta-data and weight with corresponding data source version.

### Dependence
- Theano/Tensorflow
- Keras
- Opencv
- Dlib

### Project Structure
- hub : the place to store the model, conf, log.
- doc : the place to store some documents
- dnn : the place to store the DNN structure. single dnn could have multiple conf files. however, dnn structures would constrain your conf parameters.
- sct : the place to store testing scripts.
