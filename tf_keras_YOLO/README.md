# tf-keras-YOLO

- Reimplement YOLO-v1 on tensorflow and keras. 
- keras is a nice-high level model 
- However, in order to acchive the customized-penalty-loss in yolo, we need tensorflow to do the stuff. 
- I am not aimed at to reproduce yolo result in tensorflow and keras, if you'd like to , darkflow is much awesome.
- I just want to extract the yolo-style-algorithm to test on other network architectures.
