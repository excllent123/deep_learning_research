# tf-keras-YOLO

- Reimplement YOLO-v1 on tensorflow and keras. 
- keras is a nice-high level model, however, to acchive the customized-penalty-loss in yolo, we need tensorflow to do the stuff. 

- This repo provide an alternative way to train yolo-loss from scratch, and you could use any kind of cnn-archetecture if you want.
